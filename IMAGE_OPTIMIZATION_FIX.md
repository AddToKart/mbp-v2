# Image Optimization Fix

## Problem

Images from Unsplash were causing timeout errors and taking too long to load:

- Next.js Image optimization was timing out on external images
- Console showed `TimeoutError` with code 23
- Images appeared slowly or failed to load completely

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `OptimizedImage` Component

A reusable component that handles:

- **Unoptimized Loading**: Bypasses Next.js optimization for external images using `unoptimized={true}`
- **URL Optimization**: Adds Unsplash parameters (`w=800&q=75&auto=format`) for faster loading
- **Loading States**: Shows animated skeleton while image loads
- **Error Handling**: Falls back to placeholder if image fails
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade-in effect when image loads
- **Hover Animation**: Optional scale effect with Framer Motion

### 2. Key Features

```tsx
<OptimizedImage
  src={imageUrl}
  alt={imageAlt}
  priority={false} // Set true for above-fold images
  enableHover={true} // Scale animation on hover
/>
```

**Props:**

- `src`: Image URL (automatically optimized for Unsplash)
- `alt`: Alt text for accessibility
- `priority`: Load immediately for critical images
- `enableHover`: Enable/disable hover scale animation
- `sizes`: Responsive image sizes
- `className`: Additional CSS classes

### 3. Components Updated

- ✅ `FeaturedAnnouncements.tsx` - Featured section (3 cards)
- ✅ `BlogGrid.tsx` - Latest updates (3 cards)
- ✅ `AllAnnouncementsGrid.tsx` - Full announcements page (paginated)

### 4. Performance Improvements

- **Faster Loading**: Unsplash URLs pre-optimized with width/quality parameters
- **No Timeouts**: Bypasses Next.js server-side optimization
- **Better UX**: Loading skeletons and smooth fade-in transitions
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallback to placeholder image
- **Reduced Bandwidth**: Images served at optimal size (800px width, 75% quality)

## Technical Details

### Unsplash URL Optimization

```typescript
// Before: Full-size image
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx?...

// After: Optimized
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxx?...&w=800&q=75&auto=format
```

### Loading States

1. **Initial**: Shows animated gray skeleton
2. **Loading**: Image downloads in background
3. **Complete**: Smooth fade-in transition
4. **Error**: Falls back to placeholder SVG

### Why `unoptimized={true}`?

Next.js Image optimization requires processing images through its server, which:

- Times out on slow external sources
- Adds processing overhead
- Can fail on large batches

By using `unoptimized={true}` and Unsplash's native optimization, we get:

- ✅ Faster initial load
- ✅ No server timeouts
- ✅ Unsplash CDN performance
- ✅ Proper image dimensions

## Files Modified

- `/components/OptimizedImage.tsx` - New reusable component
- `/public/placeholder-image.svg` - Fallback placeholder
- `/components/FeaturedAnnouncements.tsx` - Updated to use OptimizedImage
- `/components/BlogGrid.tsx` - Updated to use OptimizedImage
- `/components/AllAnnouncementsGrid.tsx` - Updated to use OptimizedImage

## Testing

1. Refresh the home page - images should load smoothly with skeleton
2. Navigate to `/announcements` - pagination should work without lag
3. Check browser console - no timeout errors
4. Scroll fast - images should lazy load without blocking

## Future Enhancements

- Consider implementing progressive image loading (blur-up)
- Add image caching strategy
- Implement WebP format detection
- Add retry logic for failed images
