### 1. **Created New `/announcements` Page**

Created a dedicated announcements page at `/app/announcements/page.tsx` with:

- ✅ Clean hero section matching the home page design
- ✅ SearchBar for filtering announcements
- ✅ CategoryNav for filtering by category
- ✅ BlogGrid showing all posts

### 2. **Removed SearchBar from Home Page**

- ✅ Removed SearchBar from home page (`app/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Cleaner home page flow without the sticky search bar issue

### 3. **Updated Navigation & Links**

- ✅ "Latest Updates" button in Hero → links to `/announcements`
- ✅ "Load More Posts" button → links to `/announcements`
- ✅ Navbar "Announcements" link → links to `/announcements` (was `/#announcements`)

### 4. **Removed Sticky Positioning from SearchBar**
