# Animation Testing Guide

## How to See the Staggered Animations

### Step 1: Clear Cache & Refresh

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. This does a hard refresh and clears cached JavaScript

### Step 2: Test Each Section

#### **Home Page - Featured Announcements**

1. Navigate to homepage (`/`)
2. Scroll to the very top
3. Slowly scroll down to the "Featured Announcements" section
4. **WATCH:** The 3 cards should fade in **one by one from left to right**
   - Card 1 appears first
   - Card 2 appears 0.2s later
   - Card 3 appears 0.2s after that
5. **Effect:** Smooth wave/cascade from left to right

#### **Home Page - Latest Updates (BlogGrid)**

1. Continue scrolling down on homepage
2. Find the "Latest Updates" section
3. **WATCH:** The 3 announcement cards fade in sequentially
   - Faster stagger (0.15s between each)
   - Should feel snappier than Featured section
4. **Effect:** Quick cascade from left to right

#### **Announcements Page**

1. Click "Announcements" in navbar or "Latest Updates" button
2. Scroll down past the hero/search bar
3. **WATCH:** 9 announcement cards appear in grid
   - Cards animate row by row
   - Top-left card first
   - Cascades across rows
   - Stagger: 0.12s between each card
4. **Effect:** Diagonal wave pattern across the grid

#### **Test Pagination**

1. Stay on `/announcements` page
2. Click "Next" or a page number in pagination
3. **WATCH:** New set of 9 cards animates in again
4. **Effect:** Fresh animation on each page change!

## What You Should See vs. What You Had

### Before (Old Animation):

- All cards fade in **almost simultaneously**
- Feels like a "group fade-in"
- Hard to notice individual cards animating
- Boring, generic

### After (New Staggered Animation):

- Cards appear **one after another**
- Clear **cascade/wave effect**
- Eye naturally follows the motion from left to right
- Professional, polished, like modern websites
- Each card has a slight **scale effect** (starts at 95% size, grows to 100%)

## Animation Breakdown

### Featured Announcements:

```
Time 0.0s: Section comes into view
Time 0.1s: Card 1 fades in (opacity 0 → 1, y: 40 → 0, scale: 0.9 → 1)
Time 0.3s: Card 2 fades in (same effect)
Time 0.5s: Card 3 fades in (same effect)
Total duration: ~1.1s for all 3 cards
```

### BlogGrid (Latest Updates):

```
Time 0.0s: Section comes into view
Time 0.1s: Card 1 fades in (opacity 0 → 1, y: 30 → 0, scale: 0.95 → 1)
Time 0.25s: Card 2 fades in
Time 0.40s: Card 3 fades in
Total duration: ~0.9s for all 3 cards (faster than Featured)
```

### AllAnnouncementsGrid (9 cards):

```
Time 0.0s: Page loads or pagination clicked
Time 0.05s: Card 1 fades in
Time 0.17s: Card 2 fades in (0.12s after Card 1)
Time 0.29s: Card 3 fades in
Time 0.41s: Card 4 fades in
... continues for all 9 cards
Total duration: ~1.2s for all 9 cards
```

## Troubleshooting

### "I still don't see any animation!"

**Check 1:** Are you scrolled to the top?

- Animations trigger when section enters viewport
- If you're already past the section, you missed it

**Check 2:** Is dev server running?

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Check 3:** Check browser console for errors

- Press F12
- Look for red errors
- Common issue: Framer Motion not installed

**Check 4:** Verify the changes were saved

- Check if `BlogGrid.tsx`, `AllAnnouncementsGrid.tsx`, `FeaturedAnnouncements.tsx` have the `variants` code

### "Animations are too slow/fast"

**To make animations faster:**
Edit the `staggerChildren` value in each component:

- Current: `0.2` (200ms between each card)
- Faster: `0.1` (100ms between each card)
- Fastest: `0.05` (50ms between each card)

**To make animations snappier:**
Edit the `duration` in `cardVariants`:

- Current: `0.5` or `0.6`
- Faster: `0.3` or `0.4`

## Expected User Experience

**Good staggered animation should feel like:**

- Cards "flowing in" like a gentle wave
- Natural, not jarring
- Draws your eye across the screen
- Professional and modern
- Satisfying to watch

**If it doesn't feel that way:**

- Animation might be too subtle (increase stagger delay)
- Animation might be too fast (increase duration)
- Viewport trigger might be off (adjust `margin` in viewport)

## Pro Tip: Test in Slow Motion

Want to **really see** the animation details?

**Method 1: Browser DevTools**

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Command Palette)
3. Type "animations"
4. Select "Show Animations"
5. Replay animations at 25% or 10% speed

**Method 2: Temporary Slow-Mo**
Edit the stagger values to be HUGE (just for testing):

```tsx
staggerChildren: 0.8,  // Super slow for testing
duration: 1.5,         // Super slow animation
```

Then scroll and watch - you'll clearly see each card appear one by one!

After testing, change back to normal values:

```tsx
staggerChildren: 0.15,
duration: 0.5,
```
